    1.This class is used to store boards.
    2.Use Pop and Fill to add and delete board, notice it is a stack structure which means
    the order you push and the order you pop is opposite.
    3.size is the number of boards it has stored , capacity is the ability to store
    4.Use Get to go through it ,but you can change it only with the last element(Push or Pop)
    5.There are 2 forms of array used in this class:int [9][9] and int [][81],the second format is
    only used in ToArray function.
